<h1> What is an Art Bible? </h1>
<img src="https://img.vixdata.io/pd/jpg-large/es/sites/default/files/b/biblia-1.jpg" width="400"> </br>
An Art Bible is a document that defines the art style of the videogame. 
In other words, it describes every aspect of the game in terms of what will look like, 
and avoids mixing different types of art in order to be coherent and maintain its quality. 
This document helps art department understand which direction the art takes and make everybody follow an established line. 
So, things like color scheme, the user interface or assets creation are specified here.<br/>

It is created before the art production by the art director, and after the design document, 
that establishes the function, the mechanics and the entire experience of the game. </br>

Also, an Art Bible is important to other departments like marketing, because they can use this document as a part of their strategy, 
for example to sell the product. So, as it is said, an art bible is not something that can be ignored.</br>

<h1> Content </h1>

Before doing the content, you must think about some relevant questions: </br>
- What would a team member need to now to contribute to the project?
This means that you have to transmit some kind of information I have to my team to accomplish the objectives and to not make any mistakes not predicted.</br>
- Who is my target audience of the document. It is crucial to know the understanding level of juniors and, in general, 
people who is new to the team, and redact the document adapting it to be fully understood by all members of the team, even if they come 
from different places.
- And finally, the money. Like with marketing department, an Art Bible can be a good tool to attract sponsors and producers who, if the document is perfect,
probably they will fund the project.</br>
  
The content of an art bible is generally divided into 10 parts:

- Art Style
Before starting doing something, you have to choose an art style that fits the idea of the game. If you want to do, for example,
a simulation game for kids you will choose a more cartoon style, with less details.

- Character Art
- Level of Detail (LOD)
- Camera
- Color Palette
- Atmosphere/Environment
- Texture & Surface
- User Interface
- Technical Guidelines
- References
