<h1> What is an Art Bible? </h1>
<img src="https://img.vixdata.io/pd/jpg-large/es/sites/default/files/b/biblia-1.jpg" width="600"> </br>
An Art Bible is a document that defines the art style of the videogame. 
In other words, it describes every aspect of the game in terms of what will look like, 
and avoids mixing different types of art in order to be coherent and maintain its quality. 
This document helps art department understand which direction the art takes and make everybody follow an established line. 
So, things like color scheme, the user interface or assets creation are specified here.<br/>

It is created before the art production by the art director, and after the design document, 
that establishes the function, the mechanics and the entire experience of the game. </br>

Also, an Art Bible is important to other departments like marketing, because they can use this document as a part of their strategy, 
for example to sell the product. So, as it is said, an art bible is not something that can be ignored.</br>

<h1> Content </h1>

Before doing the content, you must think about some relevant questions: </br>
- What would a team member need to now to contribute to the project? 
This means that you have to transmit some kind of information I have to my team to accomplish the objectives and to not make any mistakes not predicted.</br>
- Who is my target audience of the document. It is crucial to know the understanding level of juniors and, in general, 
people who is new to the team, and redact the document adapting it to be fully understood by all members of the team, even if they come 
from different places. </br>
- And finally, the money. Like with marketing department, an Art Bible can be a good tool to attract sponsors and producers who, if the document is perfect,
probably they will fund the project.</br>
  
The content of an art bible is generally divided into 10 parts: </br>

<h2> Art Style </h2>
The first step is choosen an art style that fits the idea of the game. If you want to do, for example,
a simulation game for kids you will choose a more cartoon style, with less details. This section has to include concepts like strokes and outlines
for characters and environment, character poses (specific for an action) or environment shapes. Basicly this will be the main sections: 
the scale of the environments, the proportions of the architecture, character proportions, technologies in use, methods of construction,
the sorts of materials in use, climate, chronology, and inhabitants of the environment. </br>

<h2> Character Art </h2> 
After defining the art style, it's necessary to go in depth with the characters. They have to be created according to the style defined,
and, in the middle of possible, be differentiated from other characters form other games. The main points are expressions, posing,
height scale comparison, colour palette, costume/drapery, and style and construction. </br>

<h2> Level of Detail (LOD) </h2> 
This aspect depends on too many factors: platform where the game is published, the amount of time artists have and, related to this, how
much effort they can dedicate to this. But it is always a good idea to take in account, because you can save a lot of resources by putting
less detail, for example when the player is not close enought. It has to be mencioned what will and will not be detailed and which
objects/decoration, and how will be achieved the aspect of increasing and decreasing the detail.</br>
